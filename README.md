# knot-prototype

This is the first implementation of Knot3 from Oct 2013 aka "the prototype", created by [Tobias Schulz](https://github.com/tobiasschulz).

It is API compatible to the version of Knot3 which was later released by six students
of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu) in collaborative work with people from the [Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung](http://www.hfg-karlsruhe.de).
Both the code and the pipe and node models are available under the conditions of the GNU General Public License v3, or any later version.
